# Project 
# Topic - Bank customer churn analysis
• This project is centered around identifying critical features associated with customers at risk of leaving the bank, incorporating a range of attributes like Customer ID, surname, and credit score etc.

• The workflow comprises data preprocessing followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), featuring graphs depicting churned and non-churned customers, as well as a correlation matrix. Subsequently, machine learning algorithms ( Random Forest and Logistic Regression) were implemented.

• The outcomes reveal that the Random Forest algorithm surpassed Logistic Regression, achieving an accuracy of 86.50%, while Logistic Regression exhibited an accuracy of 80.15%.

• The project was executed using the Python programming language, encompassing machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, EDA, and visualization techniques.
